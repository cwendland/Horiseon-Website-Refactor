# Code Refactor Starter Code

This Horiseon website initially had HTML that contained no semantic elements and therefore lacked organized structure. The images in the HTML also contained no alt attributes, making it hard for visually impaired persons to understand this website. This is a refactoring of the HTML to remedy these issues. Additionally, the CSS code needed to be refactored to reflect the changes in the semantic elements of the HTML and the CSS contained many redundancies in the code. Those were removed and the CSS was restructured to reflect that.
